Projects are individual work. No partners or collaboration are allowed
on programming projects. This policy will be enforced using computer
programs that check for unusual similarities between programs so make
sure to work independently.  Feel free to ask questions during office
hours and on the discussion board. When you need help, get help from
the course staff.
